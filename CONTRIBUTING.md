# Contributing to Thumbcloud
Thank you for contributing to Thumbcloud :smile:.


No matter if you want to report a bug, suggest a new feature or want to implement a feature yourself: **Always write an issue**

## Todo list
There is a todo section in the README.md with features waiting to be implemented.
(Please write an issue once you decided on which feature you want to work on. This way all developers now who works on which code.)

You can also allways read the code and search for `TODO` comments
